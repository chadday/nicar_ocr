# nicar_ocr
A tutorial on optical character recognition using tesseract, ImageMagick and other open source tools

## Introduction

Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a key tool in today's journalism. 



## Installation

First things first, we need to install the tools we'll be using.

    Xpdf (We'll be using the pdftotext)
    tesseract
    ImageMagick


we need to install our OCR engine, [tesseract]('https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki').

Since this is a Mac-based class, we'll following those install instructions but you can find Windows and Linux in the tesseract [documention]('https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki').

For Mac, we'll be using the Homebrew package manager. So for tesseract, you will use the following command.
```
brew install tesseract
```

And for Xpdf, you will use this.
```
brew install xpdf
```
