    "#### Example of table extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some functions that uses `pdfplumber`'s `extract_table` and `extract_words`. This example is slightly more complicated because we are using a searchable PDF created by OCR. These types of PDFs don't often have the lines, curves and rects that pdfplumber uses to parsed computer-generated text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we are using the pixel position of each word and the structure of the PDF to pass in explicit lines where each column should be separated based on our own visual inspection of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways you can find these pixel values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few common ones below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use Preview's Inspector and Rectangle Selection tools in the Tools menu. Drawing a rectangle with the left side of the box where you think the line should go will yield the pixel position in the \"Left\" box in the inspector as you draw. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can use `pdfplumber`'s built-in visual debugging tools that allow you to view the pdf page in the Jupyter notebook and draw lines where the columns should be separated. Then you record the pixels in the list as we do below. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can look for the column headers using `pdfplumber`'s `extract_words`. For example, if the column header words are unique, you could loop through all the words, add some logic to identify them and then assemble the vlines from the `x0` values. (See below with some caveats because the OCR'd pdf isn't perfect).\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with `pdfplumber`'s documention because it has many other tools and suggestions that can help extract much more complicated tables.\n"
